        question: "What is the main difference between WT and ITF Taekwondo?",
        answer: "The main difference lies in their focus and governance. World Taekwondo (WT) is the international federation governing the sport of Taekwondo and is a member of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) and International Paralympic Committee (IPC). ITF (International Taekwon-Do Federation) is a more traditional style focused on self-defense and patterns (Tul), often characterized by the 'sine wave' motion. WT focuses on speed, agility, and Olympic-style sparring.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is Superior Taekwondo a WT or ITF club?",
        answer: "Superior Taekwondo is a World Taekwondo (WT) club (formerly WTF). We align with the global standard for Olympic Taekwondo, offering our students pathways to national and international competition.",
    },
    {
        question: "Which style of Taekwondo is better for self-defense?",
        answer: "Both styles offer effective self-defense. ITF often emphasizes hand strikes and traditional self-defense scenarios earlier in the curriculum. WT, while sport-focused, integrates Hapkido-based self-defense techniques and develops superior agility, timing, and kicking power which are crucial for real-world defense.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I switch from ITF to WT Taekwondo?",
        answer: "Yes, many students switch between styles. While forms (Poomsae vs Tul) and sparring rules differ, the fundamental kicks and strikes are similar. We welcome students from ITF backgrounds and help them adapt to the WT style.",
    },
    {
        question: "Where can I find WT Taekwondo classes near me?",
        answer: "Superior Taekwondo offers WT classes in Kaukapakapa, Helensville, and Waimauku in North West Auckland. We serve the local community with professional martial arts training.",

                        When looking for martial arts classes in Auckland, you
                        might encounter two main acronyms: WT (World Taekwondo)
                        and ITF (International Taekwon-Do Federation). While
                        they share the same roots, they have evolved into
                        distinct styles with different rules, forms, and
                        philosophies.

                        1. A Tale of Two Histories
                    </h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Taekwondo's history is deeply intertwined with modern
                        Korean history. In the mid-20th century, various kwans
                        (schools) of martial arts united. General Choi Hong Hi
                        is widely credited with founding ITF in 1966,
                        emphasizing a specific style and theory of power.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Later, political differences led to a split. The World
                        Taekwondo Federation (now World Taekwondo or WT) was
                        established in 1973 in South Korea and became the
                        governing body recognized by the International Olympic
                        Committee (IOC). This split created the two distinct
                        paths we see today: ITF preserving General Choi's
                        original teachings, and WT evolving into a dynamic,
                        global sport.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        class="text-3xl font-bold font-oswald text-white uppercase mb-4"
                    >
                        2. The "Sine Wave" vs. Kinetic Flow
                    </h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        One of the most visible differences is in movement. ITF
                        practitioners utilize the "Sine Wave"—a distinct
                        up-and-down motion during movement to generate power
                        through gravity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        In contrast, **WT Taekwondo** emphasizes speed,
                        fluidity, and kinetic energy. Power is generated through
                        hip rotation and snap (fast extension). This makes WT
                        style particularly effective for rapid, multiple kicking
                        combinations, which is a hallmark of our training at
                        Superior Taekwondo.

                        3. Olympic Dreams: The WT Advantage
                    </h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        For any aspiring athlete, the Olympic dream is the
                        pinnacle of sport. <strong class="text-white"
                            >Only World Taekwondo (WT) offers a pathway to the
                            Olympic Games.</strong
                        > This is a key reason why Superior Taekwondo teaches the
                        WT curriculum.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Training in WT means our students are learning the
                        rules, techniques, and strategies used on the world
                        stage. Whether or not a student aims for the Olympics,
                        training to that standard ensures a high level of
                        athleticism, discipline, and technical proficiency.

                        A common misconception is that "Sport Taekwondo (WT)
                        doesn't work in a fight." This ignores the incredible
                        athleticism developed in WT training. A WT practitioner

                        At Superior Taekwondo, we acknowledge the sport focus
                        but integrate traditional self-defense techniques (often
                        borrowed from Hapkido) into our belt syllabus. We teach
                        students strictly not to use their skills for aggression
                        but ensuring they have the tools to protect themselves
                        if necessary.

                    The focus on continuous movement and agility in WT builds
                    exceptional cardiovascular fitness and
                    coordination—essential traits for growing kids. Furthermore,
                    the Kukkiwon certification (black belt certification)
                    provided through WT is recognized globally. If a student
                    moves from Helensville to London or New York, their rank is
                    recognized at any WT dojang.
