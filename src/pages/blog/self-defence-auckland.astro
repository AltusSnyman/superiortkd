    {
        question: "Is Taekwondo effective for real self-defence?",
        answer: "Yes. Taekwondo develops powerful leg strikes, fast reflexes, and crucially — the ability to create distance from an attacker. Distance management is the single most important self-defence skill. Olympic-level Taekwondo training builds this instinctively through thousands of hours of sparring.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are there self-defence classes near me in Auckland?",
        answer: "Superior Taekwondo offers self-defence focused training across three North West Auckland locations: Helensville, Kaukapakapa, and Waimauku. We serve students from Kumeu, Huapai, Riverhead, Westgate, and surrounding areas.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "What is the best martial art for self-defence in New Zealand?",
        answer: "There is no single 'best' martial art. However, World Taekwondo (WT) is a strong choice because it is tested under live sparring conditions, develops explosive speed and power, and teaches distance management — the most critical real-world self-defence skill.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "How long does it take to be able to defend yourself with Taekwondo?",
        answer: "After 3–6 months of consistent training, most students develop meaningful self-defence awareness, improved reflexes, and a basic toolkit of effective techniques. True confidence in a real situation comes with continued training and sparring experience.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are self-defence classes suitable for women?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Many of our adult class participants are women training specifically for confidence and personal safety. Our head instructor Andrea Kilday — a 2016 Olympian — is a woman who has made this journey herself. You will train in a safe, respectful environment.",

                There is no shortage of "self-defence classes" being advertised
                in Auckland. Weekend seminars, YouTube videos, crash courses.
                The problem? Technique learnt under no pressure, against a
                cooperating partner, in a controlled classroom, does not hold up
                when you actually need it.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Real self-defence capability is built through tens of thousands
                of repetitions, against resistance, under physical and mental
                pressure. It is built in a dojo — not a seminar room. Here is
                why Taekwondo, done consistently, is one of the most practical
                paths to genuine personal safety.

                    Why Most Self-Defence Classes Don't Actually Work
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The fitness and martial arts industry sells a lot of
                    self-defence products: short courses, seminars, apps. The
                    honest truth is that almost none of them build genuine
                    capability. Here is why:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-200 ml-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-white">No pressure testing.</strong>
                        Techniques practiced with a willing partner do not transfer
                        to a real situation where someone is resisting, moving, and
                        unpredictable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-white">No motor patterning.</strong>
                        A technique needs to be repeated thousands of times before
                        it becomes automatic. One weekend seminar gives you awareness
                        — not capability.

                        of a real threat situation can only be trained through repeated
                        exposure to controlled sparring.

                    or considered "less intimidating" — and she knows how to train
                    around it. Taekwondo's emphasis on kicks (powerful long-range
