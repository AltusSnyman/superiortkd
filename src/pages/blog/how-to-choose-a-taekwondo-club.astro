const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What should I look for when choosing a Taekwondo club?",
        answer: "Look for qualified, credentialed instructors (ideally WT-certified), a clean and safe training environment, transparent pricing, age-appropriate classes, and a positive atmosphere. Visit and try a free class before committing.",
    },
    {
        question: "Does it matter if a Taekwondo club is WT or ITF?",
        answer: "Yes. World Taekwondo (WT) is the Olympic style and offers the clearest pathway to national competition and international recognition. If your goal is sport Taekwondo or to represent New Zealand, choose a WT-affiliated club.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I know if a Taekwondo instructor is qualified?",
        answer: "A qualified WT instructor should hold a Dan grade certified by World Taekwondo and ideally have competition or coaching credentials. Ask directly for certifications. Any reputable club will be happy to share this information.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is it important to visit a Taekwondo club before joining?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Visit at least one class before signing up. Observe how the instructor treats students, whether all ages are included with care, and whether the environment feels safe and professional.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are family discounts common at Taekwondo clubs?",
        answer: "Many reputable clubs offer family discounts for multiple members. At Superior Taekwondo we offer concession rates for families training together. Always ask upfront about pricing for multiple family members.",

                Searching for a Taekwondo club in Auckland is harder than it
                looks. A quick Google search returns dozens of results — but not
                all clubs are equal. Some are run by genuinely qualified,
                competition-experienced instructors. Others are recreational
                programs dressed up with marketing language.

                any club, and why each one matters.

                    1. Is the Instructor Genuinely Qualified?
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    This is the single most important factor. In New Zealand,
                    anyone can call themselves a Taekwondo instructor. There are
                    no legal requirements for teaching martial arts. That means
                    you need to ask directly:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-200 ml-4">
                    <li>What is your Dan grade, and who certified it?</li>
                    <li>
                        Are you registered with <a

                    </li>
                    <li>Have you competed? At what level?</li>

                <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    A 1st Dan with a box-standard coaching certificate and no
                    competition history will give you a very different
                    experience to a 3rd Dan who has qualified for the Olympics.
                    The difference in depth of knowledge is enormous. At
                    Superior Taekwondo, our head instructor competed at the <strong
                        >2016 Rio Olympics</strong
                    > — that experience translates directly into every session she
                    teaches.

                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    There are two main governing bodies: <strong

                    > — the Olympic federation — and the International Taekwon-Do
                    Federation (ITF), which is a more traditional, non-Olympic style.

                    Consistency is everything in martial arts. A dojo 45 minutes
                    away might seem fine at first, but after six months you will
                    likely find attendance drops. Choose a club that fits
                    naturally into your routine. Superior Taekwondo trains
                    across three North West Auckland locations specifically so
                    that students from Helensville, Kaukapakapa, Waimauku,
                    Kumeu, Huapai, Riverhead, and Westgate all have a convenient
                    option. Check our <a
