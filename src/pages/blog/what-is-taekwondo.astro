                    Taekwondo is more than just a sport; it is a discipline, an
                    art form, and a way of life. Originating in Korea, it has
                    grown to become the most widely practiced martial art in the
                    world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Literally translated, <strong>Tae</strong> (태) means "to stomp"
                    or "to strike with the foot"; <strong>Kwon</strong> (권) means
                    "fist" or "to strike with the hand"; and <strong>Do</strong>
                    (도) means "way" or "art". Thus, Taekwondo is "The Way of the
                    Foot and Fist".

                    <p>
                        The origins of Taekwondo can be traced back over 2,000
                        years to the Three Kingdoms of Korea (Goguryeo, Baekje,
                        and Silla). Ancient warriors, such as the Hwarang,
                        practiced unarmed combat techniques known as Subak and
                        Taekkyeon, emphasizing kicking and agility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945),
                        traditional martial arts were suppressed. However,
                        masters secretly kept the traditions alive, sometimes
                        blending them with influences from Karate. After
                        liberation in 1945, the major martial arts schools
                        (Kwans) united. In 1955, the name "Taekwondo" was
                        officially chosen to unify these styles.
                    </p>

                        > in 1973 marked a turning point. Taekwondo evolved into
                        a dynamic modern sport, debuting as a demonstration sport
                        in the 1988 Seoul Olympics and becoming an official medal
                        sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Today, it is practiced
                        by millions worldwide, bridging the gap between traditional
                        discipline and modern athleticism.
