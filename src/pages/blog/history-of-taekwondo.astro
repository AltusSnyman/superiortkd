        question: "When was Taekwondo invented?",
        answer: "While its roots go back over 2,000 years to ancient Korean martial arts like Subak and Taekkyeon, the name 'Taekwondo' was officially adopted on April 11, 1955, by a committee of Korean masters.",
    },
    {
        question: "Who is the father of Taekwondo?",
        answer: "General Choi Hong Hi is widely credited as the 'Father of Taekwondo' for his role in naming and organizing the art, though many masters from the original 9 Kwans contributed significantly to its development.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why are there different styles of Taekwondo (WT vs ITF)?",
        answer: "The split occurred due to political and philosophical differences in the 1960s and 70s. ITF (International Taekwon-Do Federation) stuck to General Choi's original traditional style, while WT (World Taekwondo) developed into the modern Olympic sport we practice today.",
    },
    {
        question: "When did Taekwondo become an Olympic sport?",
        answer: "Taekwondo debuted as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and became an official medal sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is Taekwondo related to Karate?",
        answer: "Yes, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, many Korean masters studied Karate. Modern Taekwondo blends these linear strikes with the circular, fluid kicking techniques of indigenous Korean arts like Taekkyeon.",

                    To practice Taekwondo is to participate in a history that
                    spans millennia. Every bow, every form, and every command in
                    the dojang echoes the traditions of the past.

                    At <strong>Superior Taekwondo</strong>, we teach more than
                    just kicking and punching. We teach a heritage. Whether you

                        The history of Korean martial arts begins in the era of
                        the Three Kingdoms: <strong>Goguryeo</strong>, <strong
                            >Baekje</strong
                        >, and <strong>Silla</strong>. Archaeological findings,
                        such as murals in the Muyongchong (Royal Tomb of the
                        Dancers), depict warriors engaging in unarmed combat
                        resembling modern Taekwondo.

                    <p>Two primary indigenous arts emerged during this time:</p>

                            <strong>Subak (수박):</strong> A fighting style focusing
                            on hand strikes and grappling.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Taekkyeon (택견):</strong> A fluid, rhythmic
                            art emphasizing high, fluid kicks and footwork. This
                            art is the primary ancestor of Taekwondo's dynamic kicking
                            style.

                    <p>
                        During the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), Confucianism
                        replaced Buddhism as the state ideology. Scholarly
                        pursuits were valued over martial arts, causing Subak
                        and Taekkyeon to decline, practiced only as folk games
                        by commoners.

                        The Japanese Occupation (1910-1945)
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Korea's annexation by Japan brought a ban on all Korean
                        cultural practices, including martial arts. However,
                        this period paradoxically shaped modern Taekwondo. Many
                        Koreans studying in Japan learned <strong>Karate</strong

                    <p>
                        When Korea was liberated in 1945, masters returned with
                        a unique blend of skills: the linear, powerful strikes
                        of Karate combined with the fluid, high-kicking
                        traditions of ancient Taekkyeon.
