        question: "What age group is the General Class for?",
        answer: "The General Class is for teenagers (roughly 13+) and adults of all ages. We regularly have students in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. There is no upper age limit — Taekwondo is a lifelong pursuit.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to be fit to start?",
        answer: "No. We build your fitness as part of the process. Every class includes warm-up, conditioning, and cool-down components tailored to the group's level. You will improve your fitness naturally over weeks and months.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need any prior martial arts experience?",
        answer: "Not at all. The General Class is designed to welcome complete beginners and continue developing experienced practitioners simultaneously. Our coaches are skilled at individualising instruction within group settings.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will I have to spar?",
        answer: "Sparring is introduced gradually and is never forced. Beginner students start with non-contact drills. Full-contact sparring with protective gear is introduced once a student has developed sufficient confidence and technique.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long before I earn my first belt?",
        answer: "Most students complete their first grading after approximately 3 months of regular attendance. The colour belt progression continues roughly every 3–4 months with consistent training and grading preparation.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I train if I have an injury or physical limitation?",
        answer: "In many cases, yes. Please discuss any injuries or limitations with our coaches before your first class. We modify training plans where possible and work within your capabilities safely.",

                        >Superior Taekwondo</a
                    > is the heart of what we do. It is where beginners take their
                    first steps, where intermediate students sharpen their skills,
                    and where experienced practitioners continue to grow. It is a

                    Every class is structured to deliver progress across all
                    four pillars of Taekwondo: <strong
                        >striking and kicking technique</strong
                    >, <strong>Poomsae (patterns)</strong>, <strong
                        >sparring</strong
                    >, and <strong>physical conditioning</strong>. Over time,
                    these pillars reinforce each other — better technique makes
                    sparring more effective, conditioning makes technique
                    sharper, and patterns build the mechanical foundation for
                    everything else.
                </p>

                    Our General Class is for teenagers and adults across the

                    the first time or returning to Taekwondo after years away,

                        We take our responsibility as coaches seriously. When

                        access to a training space — you are joining a community
                        with coaches who genuinely care about your progress.

                        will celebrate your improvements and address your
                        weaknesses directly, because honest feedback is the
                        fastest path to real growth. We will not flatter you or
                        rush your grading for revenue.
