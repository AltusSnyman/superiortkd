        question: "What age is Tiny Tigers for?",
        answer: "Tiny Tigers is designed for children aged 5 to approximately 10 years old. The class format is tailored specifically for young attention spans, energy levels, and developmental stages.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "My child has never done a martial art before — is that okay?",
        answer: "Absolutely. The class is designed for complete beginners. We use games, stations, and age-appropriate drills to introduce concepts gradually in a way that feels fun, not overwhelming.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will my child be taught to fight?",
        answer: "Taekwondo teaches controlled, purposeful movement — not fighting. The Tiny Tigers programme emphasises self-control, respect, and discipline at all times. Any partner work is non-contact or very lightly supervised contact with protective pads only.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long are the classes?",
        answer: "Tiny Tigers classes are typically 45–60 minutes — an appropriate duration for young children to stay engaged and absorb learning without fatigue or attention drift.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do children get belts and belt grades?",
        answer: "Yes. Children progress through the Junior Colour Belt system, which includes half-belt increments (e.g., white-yellow, yellow) to provide more frequent recognition of progress. Gradings are a positive, encouraging experience.",
    },
    {
        question: "What do parents do during class?",
        answer: "Parents are welcome to observe from a designated viewing area. We encourage you to watch and celebrate your child's progress. Many parents find it inspiring enough to eventually join an adult class themselves!",

                    The greatest gift you can give a child is belief in
                    themselves — and that starts here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Tiny Tigers programme at <a

                        class="text-blue-belt-end hover:underline"
                        >Superior Taekwondo</a
                    > is purpose-built for young children aged 5 and up. We understand
                    that young children are not simply small adults — they have different
                    learning styles, attention spans, and developmental needs. Our
                    Tiny Tigers classes are designed by coaches who understand child
                    development, not just Taekwondo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every session blends age-appropriate martial arts
                    instruction with engaging games, movement challenges, and
                    character-building activities. Children learn to listen,
                    focus, follow instructions, and respect others — without
                    ever feeling like they are being lectured. The lessons come
                    through the training itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result? Children who stand taller, look adults in the
                    eye with confidence, take their responsibilities seriously,
                    and approach challenges with a "I'll try again" mindset.
                    These are not just martial arts skills — they are life
                    skills that Taekwondo uniquely delivers.
