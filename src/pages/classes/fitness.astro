        question: "Do I need Taekwondo experience to join the Fitness Class?",
        answer: "No experience required. The Fitness Class is open to anyone looking for a physically demanding, martial arts-inspired workout. No sparring or contact is involved — it is pure conditioning training.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from the General Class?",
        answer: "The General Class follows the full Taekwondo curriculum — technique, patterns, sparring, and grading. The Fitness Class focuses exclusively on physical conditioning: cardio, strength, explosiveness, and mobility. It is complementary to, not a replacement for, the General Class.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will I get injured?",
        answer: "We take injury prevention seriously. Every session includes proper warm-up and cool-down. Intensity is progressive and movement quality is prioritised over load or speed. Beginners are coached carefully through all movements.",
    },
    {
        question: "What should I expect in a typical session?",
        answer: "Expect a full-body workout using bag work, pad drills, agility ladders, plyometrics, and functional strength exercises. Sessions are structured with clear warm-up, working, and recovery phases. You will finish dripping with sweat and feeling excellent.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is this suitable for people who want to lose weight?",
        answer: "Yes. High-intensity martial arts conditioning is one of the most effective methods for improving body composition. Combined with proper nutrition, consistent Fitness Class attendance produces significant results.",
    },
    {
        question:
            "Can existing Taekwondo students do this class as well as their regular training?",
        answer: "Absolutely — and we recommend it. Competition athletes especially benefit from the dedicated conditioning focus. Many of our General and Competition class students also attend the Fitness Class to develop their athletic base.",

                    > brings the conditioning methods of elite martial artists to
                    anyone willing to put in the work. No experience in Taekwondo,
                    no fighting, no contact — just real, purposeful training designed
                    to transform your body and athletic capacity.

                <p>
                    This is not a bootcamp with kicks painted on. Every
                    exercise, every drill, every movement pattern in this class
                    is drawn from the actual conditioning practices of
                    competitive Taekwondo athletes. That means it is functional,
                    specific, and effective in a way that generic gym workouts
                    simply cannot replicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The focus areas of our Fitness Class are: <strong
                        >explosive power</strong
                    > (the ability to generate force rapidly), <strong
                        >fight-endurance cardio</strong
                    > (interval and sustained capacity training), <strong
                        >functional mobility</strong
                    > (flexibility and range of motion that actually transfers to
                    movement), and <strong>core stability</strong> (the foundation
                    for everything else). These are not random — they are the exact
                    physical qualities that separate good athletes from elite ones.
